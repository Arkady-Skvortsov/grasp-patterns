# Basics

(Wikipedia): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)
(Gregg Lerhman's patterns): https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/samplechapter/0/1/3/0/0130925691.pdf

# Motivation

I'm undone already, even programmer reading that, thinking - I'm crazy, like this poor fellow that reading your code at work every day too, my feelings are hurt;

GRASP patterns, unlike SOLID principles, look more realistic to use (P.S. at least they can be quickly entered into); They will help you write cleaner and more maintainable code in the OOP paradigm, don't thank Lerman for that)

So, like SOLID - that's going from OOP principles: 1) Incapsulation, 2) Inheritance, 3) Polymorphism

(The author also gives real examples of use and tries to use them where necessary to strengthen this in practice, like SOLID)

**The main idea that you need to remember is that when you become an architect and start building a class diagram in UML or build it in your free time - that all these GRASP, SOLID and GoF along with the basic 3 principles of OOP 100% fall on architecture, because it may not be a class, but it may be a component or a file**
